We selected one paragraph from CRA website as ground truth text and then generated a handwriting version of it. After apply on the Python API using the OCR product offered by one of the vendors, we can obtain the text generated from handwriting. Stored both ground truth text and generated text as .txt document type and we can then use the Python function from spaCy library to calculate the similarity score between ground truth text and generated text. The similarity score is calculated base on Accuracy.
Moreover, we can also use precision and recall to evaluate the OCR result.
